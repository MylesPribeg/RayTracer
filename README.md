# RayTracer

This is a ray tracer written from scratch in C++. It is based on the Ray Tracing in One Weekend books but has been extended 
to include features such as external model loading, multithreading, orthographic projection, environment mapping, additional
materials, orthographic projection among others.

I am constantly working to improve it and upcoming features include Normal mapping, non-uniform volumes, a GUI with scene 
previews using OpenGL, and GPU compute for rendering.


# Usage

I am still working on creating a user friendly interface, hopefully even a GUI. If you are very determined, however, it is possible to build the code and change between some premade scenes using a switch in the main function.

# Examples of Output

These are some scenes rendered using the ray tracer.
